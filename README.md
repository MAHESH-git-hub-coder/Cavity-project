# Cavity-project
The superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) cavity plays an essential role in various areas like superconducting qubits, parametric amplifiers, radiation detectors, and studying magnon-photon and photon-phonon coupling. In this work, we measure the charge compressibility of bilayer graphene coupled to a half-wavelength SCPW cavity. Our approach provides a means to detect subtle changes in the capacitance of the bilayer graphene heterostructure, which depends on the compressibility of bilayer graphene. This method holds promise for exploring a wide class of van der Waals 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and their moir√©, where DC transport measurement is challenging.
